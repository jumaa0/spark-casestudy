# Batch and Stream Processing Solutions

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of batch and stream processing solutions to address inefficiencies in processing large volumes of transaction data for a financial services company. The case study focuses on optimizing both historical data analysis and real-time data processing to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Project Structure

- **data_ingestoin/**: Contains scripts and resources for the data ingestoin.
- **batch_processing/**: Contains scripts and resources for the batch processing solution.
- **stream_processing/**: Contains scripts and resources for the stream processing solution.
- **data/**: Sample data used for both batch and stream processing.
- **docs/**: Documentation and resources for the project.

## Data Sources

- **Types of Data**: Transaction logs, customer profiles, and real-time event streams.
- **Volume and Velocity**: Historical data amounting to several terabytes (batch processing) and high-velocity real-time data streams (stream processing).

## Goals

### Batch Processing
- Efficiently process large datasets to generate nightly reports.
- Perform comprehensive historical data analysis.

### Stream Processing
- Process real-time data streams to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Provide real-time analytics to support immediate decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Batch Processing**: Hadoop, Spark
- **Stream Processing**: Kafka, Spark
- **Data Storage**: HDFS, Cassandra

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Flink
- Python
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., virtualenv)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jumaa0/spark-casestudy.git
    cd ~/casestudy/
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Start Hadoop and Spark clusters**:
    Follow the official documentation to set up and start Hadoop and Spark clusters.

5. **Start Kafka and Flink**:
    Follow the official documentation to set up and start Kafka and Flink.

## Usage

### Batch Processing

1.**Navigate to the data ingestion directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ingest
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the batch processing directory**:
    ```bash
    cd batch_etl
    ```

3. **Run the batch processing job**:
    ```bash
    spark-submit main_etl.py
    ```

### Stream Processing

1. **Navigate to the stream processing directory**:
    ```bash
    cd stream_etl
    ```

2. **Start the stream processing job**:
    ```bash
    spark-submit \
    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.8 \
    casestudy/stream_etl/streaming_job.py
    ```

## Results

### Batch Processing
- Generated nightly reports.
- Performed historical data analysis with insights.

### Stream Processing
- Detected fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Provided real-time analytics dashboards.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges
- Integrating multiple data sources with varying velocities.
- Ensuring low latency in stream processing.

### Solutions
- Utilized Kafka for efficient data ingestion.
- Optimized Flink jobs for low-latency processing.

## Future Work

- Extend the batch processing pipeline to include more complex data transformations.
- Improve the real-time processing pipeline for better scalability.
